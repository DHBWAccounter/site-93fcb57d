            Bitcoin has the potential not only to revolutionize online payments, but also to give control over their financial transactions and assets back to individuals, and to serve as an asset with exceptionally strong property guarantees.

As an Association, we want to pave the way for Bitcoin to flourish and unfold its full potential.
